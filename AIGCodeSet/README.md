# LLM vs Human Code Dataset  
_A Benchmark Dataset for AI-generated and Human-written Code Classification_

## Description
This dataset contains code samples generated by various Large Language Models (LLMs), including CodeStral (Mistral AI), Gemini (Google DeepMind), and CodeLLaMA (Meta), along with human-written codes from CodeNet. The dataset is designed to support research on distinguishing LLM-generated code from human-written code.

## Dataset Structure

### 1. LLM-generated Dataset (`created_dataset_with_llms.csv`)
| Column             | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| problem_id          | Unique problem ID from CodeNet.                                                             |
| submission_id       | Submission ID from CodeNet. `"submission_id == unrelated"` indicates purely LLM-generated code. |
| LLM                 | Model used: `"CODESTRAL"`, `"GEMINI"`, or `"LLAMA"`.                                         |
| status_in_folder    | Code status: `"wrong"`, `"runtime"`, `"generate"`.                                          |
| code                | Code generated by the corresponding LLM.                                                    |
| label               | Always `1` (LLM-generated code).                                                            |

### 2. Human-written Dataset (`human_selected_dataset.csv`)
| Column             | Description                                                                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| problem_id          | Unique problem ID from CodeNet.                                                               |
| submission_id       | Submission ID from CodeNet.                                                                   |
| (12 CodeNet columns)| Metadata columns directly provided by CodeNet.                                                |
| LLM                 | Always `"Human"`.                                                                             |
| status_in_folder    | Submission status: `"wrong"`, `"runtime"`, `"accepted"`.                                      |
| code                | Human-written code.                                                                           |
| label               | Always `0` (Human-written code).                                                              |

### 3. Final Dataset (`all_data_with_ada_embeddings_will_be_splitted_into_train_test_set.csv`)
Merged dataset with the following additional columns:
| Column             | Description                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ada_embedding       | Ada embedding vectors of the code.               |
| lines               | Total number of lines.                           |
| code_lines          | Number of non-empty code lines.                  |

| blank_lines         | Number of blank lines.                           |

*Feature extraction scripts are provided in the accompanying Python files.*

## Generation Method
- LLM outputs were generated as described in the paper: [arxiv.org/abs/2412.16594](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16594)
- Human codes were selected from CodeNet and annotated with metadata.
- For code features, custom scripts calculated line counts, comments, functions, etc.
